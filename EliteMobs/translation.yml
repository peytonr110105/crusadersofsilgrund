ZombieNecronomicon:
  Summoned zombie: Summoned Zombie
  Summoned skeleton: Summoned Skeleton
  Summoning chant: Nor is it to be thought...that man is either the oldest or the
    last of earth's masters, or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone.
    The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not in the spaces
    we know, but between them, they walk serene and primal, undimensioned and to us
    unseen. Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the
    key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth.
    He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through
    again. He knows where They had trod earth's fields, and where They still tread
    them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread. By Their smell can men sometimes
    know Them near, but of Their semblance can no man know, saving only in the features
    of those They have begotten on mankind; and of those are there many sorts, differing
    in likeness from man's truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance
    which is Them. They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have
    been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with
    Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness. They bend the forest
    and crush the city, yet may not forest or city behold the hand that smites. Kadath
    in the cold waste hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath? The ice desert of
    the South and the sunken isles of Ocean hold stones whereon Their seal is engraver,
    but who hath seen the deep frozen city or the sealed tower long garlanded with
    seaweed and barnacles? Great Cthulhu is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only
    dimly. Iä! Shub-Niggurath! As a foulness shall ye know Them. Their hand is at
    your throats, yet ye see Them not; and Their habitation is even one with your
    guarded threshold. Yog-Sothoth is the key to the gate, whereby the spheres meet.
    Man rules now where They ruled once; They shall soon rule where man rules now.
    After summer is winter, after winter summer. They wait patient and potent, for
    here shall They reign again.
